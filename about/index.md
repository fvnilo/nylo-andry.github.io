I am a software developer in Canada. I attended the Collège de Maisonneuve where I got my DEC and then I went to l'École de Technologie Supérieure where I got my bachelor's degree in software engineering.


My last two years as a developer were almost entirely dedicated to web development. The applications I built so far are made with JavaScript, Node.js, Java and various NoSQL databases. Software architecture is one of my biggest interest in the field of software engineering. I love new technologies and share what I learn about them. The more I learn, the more I want to share.


In my spare time, I am a jazz musician, a cooking enthusiast, a basket-ball fan, a cinephile, a crime/mafia book reader and human.
