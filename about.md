My name is Ny Fanilo Andrianjafy. I was born in Antananarivo Madagascar and currently reside in Montréal, Canada. I have lived in Canada most of my life but I firmly believe that our era has no boundaries, thanks to the internet. I am a Front-End Developer at [Solutions Médias 360](https://www.360.agency/en/compagnies/sm360-ca360/) where we build solutions to revolutionize the way we buy cars.

My main interests are building UI's, UX, DevOps and Functional Programming. I have been coding in JavaScript for 5 years and I started to hack in Elm and Haskell. 

In my free time, I play music with my band, roam around the city to take pictures, travel and board games in solo or with friend.
