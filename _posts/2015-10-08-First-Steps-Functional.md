In one of my previous [post](http://nylo-andry.github.io/Functional-programming-intro/), I discussed about the fundamental concepts of functional programming. Some people asked me where I think they should begin. They like the idea. They want to try it out on their projects. The problem is that it might be difficult to identify where to begin. This is quite comprehensible considering that there are many languages you can pick up but some you might read that this language you chose is not really functional or this other language is pure so you should learn it. There are a lot of them. You could jump into Erlang, Haskell or Elixir for various reasons.

Frankly, I do not believe there is a blessed definition of what is a functional language. I consider my first steps with functional programming to be with JavaScript in the sense that JavaScript has higher order functions, closures and functions are first class objects. From that initial point, I explored my possibilities. Today, as I am writing this post, I am more of a [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) person than anything else. I hated LISP when I was in college, but I learned to look at it from another perspective and now I simply love it. I write my projects in Clojure and I just love the way it is represented. I love the simplicity (Yes! Really! LISP code is simple) of my code and how I can easily reason about it.

That being said, making the transition from [C-like languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages) to LISP is hardcore. It turns your perspective upside-down and can be quite difficult to grasp at first. I believe, and this is my opinion, that the smoothest transition to functional programming is to begin with Scala. Especially for people coming from Java, Scala is a great transition point because it runs on the JVM and it is a functional and also an object-oriented language.

With Scala, you actually have nice features like:

- Pattern Matching;
- Higher Order Functions;
- Functions as First-class Objects;

And there is a great deal of resources to do Functional Reactive Programming with Scala.

You can consult the documentation of Scala and read it all in great depth. Don't get me wrong, Martin Odersky did a great job with the documentation and the language itself, but programmers generally do not like to read long documentation to learn (wink). I recommend this [Scala Tutorial](https://blog.udemy.com/scala-tutorial-getting-started-with-scala/) from Udemy that gets you started from creating simple projects in IntelliJ to use combinators and define Traits. The transition from object-oriented programming can begin here as you will see concepts that you should totally be familiar with. From that point, I recommend you choose your own dosage. Try to find the balance that fits you between OO and FP.

Speaking for myself, I began with Scala for a few months and decided later on to jump into Clojure, but it is with Scala that I learned most of what I know today about Functional Programming. My way is not necessarily yours. You can build great things with Scala. What counts is how comfortable you are.

Happy Learning !
